/**
 * SimpleObjectWriter is a small class to wrap around the usual ObjectOutputStream
 * to shield you from the exception handling which we haven't yet gotten
 * to in class. 
 * <P>It has just three methods of note: one to open a new file for writing,
 * one to write an object to the file, and one to close the
 * the file when done. 
 * <P>Here is a simple example that shows using the SimpleObjectWriter
 * to create a new file and write some objects into it:
 * <PRE>
 *    SimpleObjectWriter writer = SimpleObjectWriter.openFileForWriting("objects");
 *    if (writer == null) {
 *       System.out.println("Couldn't open file!");
 *       return;
 *    }
 *    writer.writeObject("Here is a string");
 *    writer.writeObject("And another one.");
 *    writer.writeObject(new Date());
 *    writer.close();
 * </PRE>
 * <P>You are free to edit or extend this class, but we don't expect that
 * you should need to make any changes.
