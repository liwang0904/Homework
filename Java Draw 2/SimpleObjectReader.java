/**
 * SimpleObjectReader is a small class to wrap around the usual ObjectStream
 * to shield you from the exception handling which we haven't yet gotten
 * to in class. 
 * <P>It has just three methods of note: one to open a new file for reading,
 * one to read an object from an open file, and one to close the file when done.
 *
 * <P>Any object that you attempt to read must properly implement the Serializable
 * interface. Here is a simple example that shows using the SimpleFileReader to
 * to rehydrate objects from a file and print them:
 * <PRE>
 *    SimpleObjectReader reader = SimpleObjectReader.openFileForReading("shapes");
 *    if (reader == null) {
 *        System.out.println("Couldn't open file!");
 *        return;
 *    }
 *    Object obj;
 *    while ((obj = reader.readObject()) != null)
 *        System.out.println(obj);
 *    reader.close();
 * </PRE>
 * <P>You are free to edit or extend this class, but we don't expect that
 * you should need to make any changes.
 *
